# PHYS494
Here is instructions on how to set up and run the code:

- Insure Arudino IDE is installed on the computer which you plan to connect to. 
- Set up Arduino IDE by having the board set to Arduino Uno
- Download the code on this repo and open it in Arduino IDE
- Once the board is connected you should be able to hit the arrow button to run the code on the board.

Changing paramters in the code:
- There should be comments wihtin the code that are noted by ' // ' these will tell you which variable changes what.
- Comments noted by ' // # ' are going to be used for explaining what each part of the code does

Connecting the Arduino to the LED
- ensure the LED is first connected to ground and either the V or the 3.5V
- Then within the code there is a pin number which will give the signal to the LEDs. Either the LED needs to be connected to this in order to work, or the pin number in the code needs to be changed
